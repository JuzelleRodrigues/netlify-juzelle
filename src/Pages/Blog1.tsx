        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>
          A professional headshot is more than just a picture; it's a visual
          representation of 'YOU' as a 'BRAND'. It can significantly impact your
          professional image, whether you're networking, applying for jobs, or
          building your online presence. A well-executed headshot can convey
          confidence, competence, and approachability - Need of the hour!
        </p>
        <h3>Technical Commentary</h3>
        <h4>Aperture (f/2.2)</h4>
        <p>
          This setting is good for isolating the subject from the background, a
          greater depth of field, ensuring that the entire face is in focus. The
          number could go higher but as per my image tests I really liked the
          way my face looked in the (f/2.2) setting. Not too broad and not too
          long.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Shutter Speed (1/33 sec)</h4>
        <p>
          While a faster shutter speed (like 1/125 sec) is generally recommended
          for sharp headshots to minimize motion blur, a slower shutter speed
          like 1/33 sec can be used under certain conditions. In my case the
          camera was kept stable - whilst the room I was clicking the image in
          was not well lit up. Hence, the use of a slower shutter speed to allow
          more light to enter the camera sensor. It proved to be beneficial
          since there was no other external light source.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>ISO (ISO-606)</h4>
        <p>
          The ISO setting added noise to the image, but since there was no
          external light source and the lighting in the room was not great, a
          higher ISO was the only option, which slightly reduced the overall
          image quality.
        </p>
        <br></br>
        <h4>Focal Length (3mm)</h4>
        <p>
          A 3mm focal length is typically not ideal for a professional headshot.
          50mm or more, is generally preferred for professional photography -
          but in my case the distance between the cameraperson and me was hardly
          around 2 steps, which is why a 3mm focal length was used.
